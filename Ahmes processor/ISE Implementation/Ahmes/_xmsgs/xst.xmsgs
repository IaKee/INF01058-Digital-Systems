<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="647" delta="new" >Input &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">instruction_flags&lt;8:8&gt;</arg>&gt; is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="new" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">1</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">flag_V</arg>&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
