This is a Python program that converts output text files generated by the Neander processor simulator into the .coe format. The .coe format is used to initialize memory components in testbenches of VHDL projects developed in the Digital Systems course. The program takes command-line arguments as input, where each argument is the path to a Neander output file. The program reads each file, parses the instructions, and generates a .coe file for each input file.

The program uses the sys module to read the command-line arguments and the built-in open function to read and write files. The program uses a memory_vector list to store the parsed instructions and two strings to generate the .coe file. The string0 variable contains the "memory_initialization_radix=10;" line, and the string1 variable contains the "memory_initialization_vector=" line followed by the comma-separated instruction values.

The program loops through each input file, reads the contents of the file, parses the instructions, generates the .coe file, and writes the contents of the .coe file to disk. If an error occurs during file reading or writing, the program prints an error message and exits with a return code of -1.

Overall, this program provides a convenient way to convert Neander simulator output files to a format compatible with VHDL testbenches in the Digital Systems course.
