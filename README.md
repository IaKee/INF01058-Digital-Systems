# INF01058 - Digital Systems

This repository contains my assignments and projects for the INF01058 Digital Systems course taught by Professor Fernanda Gusm√£o de Lima Kasternsmidt. The course covers topics related to digital systems and their design using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as VHDL.

Throughout the course, I will be working with FPGAs to design and implement digital circuits. I will be introduced to VHDL, and will learn about the syntax, basic data types, and concurrent and sequential assignments. I will also learn how to design and simulate circuits such as adders, multipliers, and state machines using VHDL.

Additionally, it is introduced the use of memories and communication protocols such as handshake protocols. The course includes both theoretical and practical aspects, giving the opportunity to work with FPGA development boards to implement and test the circuits designed.
